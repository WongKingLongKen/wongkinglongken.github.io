            <h1>Roman Ring</h1>
            <p>Research Engineer at DeepMind</p>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I began my career as a self-taught web developer, specializing in the Symfony PHP framework, while working on projects of various scales in many different domains such as finance, education, and health.</p>
            <p>After five years of work experience, I decided to pivot my career and take an active part in the research and development of a field I am very passionate about – artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>To fulfill this goal, I had to catch up on missed education, starting with a bachelor’s degree. I chose to pursue an undergraduate degree in mathematical statistics to complement my programming skills with a strong mathematical foundation. In the summer of 2018, I successfully defended my bachelor’s thesis, replicating DeepMind’s preliminary results and architecture with deep reinforcement learning methods in the StarCraft II learning environment.</p>
            <p>I continued my education with a master’s in computer science, filling in the blanks in the theory I missed beforehand. In the summer of 2019, I interned as a research engineer at DeepMind in London, UK; contributing to the AlphaStar project, and experimenting with the JAX library. In March of 2020, I joined DeepMind as a research engineer.</p>

                <h3>The Next Generation of Machine Learning Tools</h3>
                <p><time datetime="2020-01-22">Jan 22, 2020</time> | 15 min read</p>
                <p>Have you ever wondered how will the machine learning frameworks of the ‘20s look like? In this essay, I examine the directions AI research might take and the requirements they impose on the tools at our disposal, concluding with an overview of what I believe to be the two strong candidates: JAX and S4TF.</p>

                <h3>Deep Reinforcement Learning With TensorFlow 2.1</h3>
                <p><time datetime="2020-01-13">Jan 13, 2020</time> | 13 min read</p>
                <p>In this tutorial, I will give an overview of the TensorFlow 2.x features through the lens of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) by implementing an advantage actor-critic (A2C) agent, solving the classic CartPole-v0 environment. While the goal is to showcase TensorFlow 2.x, I will do my best to make DRL approachable as well, including a birds-eye overview of the field.</p>

                <h3>StarCraft II: Next Big Thing in AI</h3>
                <p><time datetime="2019-01-24">Jan 24, 2019</time> | 10 min read</p>
                <p>After winning against Go world champion Lee Sedol in 2016, DeepMind has announced the next challenge they will focus on: StarCraft II. Today they are finally ready to unveil something at 6PM GMT and with this blog post I want to help both StarCraft players and AI researchers appreciate the scope of what they’re about to experience.</p>

                <h3>Why I Majored in Statistics for a Career in Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                <p><time datetime="2019-01-05">Jan 5, 2019</time> | 5 min read</p>
                <p>Undergraduate major is often the first significant career decision a person makes in his life. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more and more ingrained in our society, many people begin to consider a career in AI as a viable choice in their life. However, it is still very rare to have an undergraduate degree fully dedicated to AI, so people opt for what they perceive to be the next best thing - computer science. But I believe there is a better alternative: statistics, and in this blog post I will try to explain why, based on my own example.</p>
